# Todo list

## Simworld

### Board
- Add "update-neighbours" iteration, or use other idea to store neighbourhood.
=> maybe simply calculate neighbours in game logic. (Rigid system exists!)

### Visualization
- find input values of networkX

### SW class:
- legal-moves function
- Remove if test on start of all directions. One is enough!
